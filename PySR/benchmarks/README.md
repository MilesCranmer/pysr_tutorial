# Benchmark 1

The following benchmarks were ran with this command on a node on CCA's BNL cluster (40-cores). At no time was the node fully busy. The tags were put into the file `tags.txt`, and the `benchmark.sh` was copied to the root folder. This is the command used:

```bash
for x in $(cat tags.txt); do sleep 120 && git checkout $x &> /dev/null && nohup ./benchmark.sh > performance_v3_$x.txt &; done
```
with this API call in `benchmark.sh`
```python
eq = pysr(X, y, binary_operators=["plus", "mult", "div", "pow"], unary_operators=["sin"], niterations=20, procs=4, parsimony=1e-10, population_size=1000, ncyclesperiteration=1000)
```
